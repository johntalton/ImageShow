ImageShow1.0 (beta5.x)
by YNOP

Ok Here we go, Beta5.x.  Most everything I originaly wanted if now finished.  It's a verry useable image view now. It can save all Translator types, Set the current Image as the Desktop Image(streched,centered,tilled). Display the image in a variaty of veiwing modes, it accepts refs from double clicking on a file and drag and drop. It's even a little faster than other image views, And its verry stable.  I am a poor student here Adopt-a-App, Send money.

Oh ya .. and if you think that there is just some feature that ImageView should have .. let me know.  I am open to anything.

All splash images were done by ynop useing ArtPaint - a wonderful BeOS art program.

Try finding that hiden about box :)

ver 1.0 Beta 3.2:
	FIXED THE 60 IMAGE LIMIT BUG
	99% of the credit goes to Dragfly (yes the guy who wrote Butterfly)
	This was a stupid bug that we should all learn from.
	BNodeInfo NI(new BNode(path.Path())); Is BAD it should read
	BNode *nod = new BNode(path.Path()); BNodeInfo NI(nod); ... delete nod;
	You see we where creating lots of BNodes and thus the OS said "No more for you!"
